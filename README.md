The correct file will have a total of 600 images, that are split into two folders named 'Crop' and 'Full' with 300 images each.

# Before running the code

1. Make sure all the files from this repository are allocted in one folder 
2. Have an anaconda3 environment
3. Running a the recent python 3 kernal on JupyterLab (I am using version 3.11.3 on a Mac OS)
4. Have all the dependancies installed: tensorflow, os, numpy and openCV ("!pip install x dependancy")

# How to run the code

To run the code press "Restart all kernals and Run all cells" located in the Run tab
