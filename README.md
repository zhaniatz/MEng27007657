The image classification used in this project was created by Nicholas Renotte and follows his tutorial on "Build a Deep CNN Image Classifier with ANY Images". The code was adjusted and commented to fit the image dataset using this proect.

# Downloading the Datset
Download the Capillary dataset using the link to the GoogleDrive. After downloading, add this file to the working directory. 

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OaiaX-goziPxSSVYteMTRG-od73tOZfy?usp=share_link

The correct file will have a total of 600 images, that are split into two folders named 'Crop' and 'Full' with 300 images each.

# Before running the code

1. Make sure all the files from this repository are allocted in one folder, and add the downloaded dataset to this. 
2. Have an anaconda3 environment running
3. Running the recent python 3 kernal on JupyterLab (I am using Python version 3.11.3 on a Mac OS)
4. Have all the dependancies installed: tensorflow, os, numpy and openCV ("!pip install x dependancy")

# How to run the code

To run the code press "Restart all kernals and Run all cells" located in the Run tab
